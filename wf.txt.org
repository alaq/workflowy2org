** DONE Lucid dreaming task 1
*** Look: Become aware of what you see: notice the richly varied and vivid impressions—shapes, colors, movement, dimensionality, the entire visible world.
*** Listen: Become aware of what you hear: register the various sounds taken in by your ears—a diverse range of intensities, pitches, and tonal qualities, perhaps including the commonplace miracle of speech or the wonder of music.
*** Feel: Become aware of what you touch: texture (smooth, rough, dry, sticky, or wet), weight (heavy, light, solid, or empty), temperature, and the rest. Also note how your body feels right now and compare that to the many other ways it feels at other times, tired or energetic, stiff or limber, painful or pleasant, and so on.
*** Taste: Become aware of what it is like to taste: taste a number of different foods and substances, or remember and vividly imagine their tastes.
*** Smell: Become aware of what you smell: the odor of warm bodies, earth, incense, smoke, perfume, coffee, onions, alcohol, and the sea. Remember and imagine as many of them as you can.
*** Breathing: Attend to your breathing. A moment ago you probably were not consciously aware of your breathing even though you have inhaled and exhaled fifty times while doing this exercise. Hold your breath for a few seconds. Let it out. Now take a deep breath. Notice that being conscious of your breathing allows you to alter it deliberately.
*** Emotions: Become aware of your feelings. Remember the difference between anger and joy, serenity and excitement, and as many other emotions as you care to feel. How real do emotions feel?
*** Thoughts: Become aware of your thoughts. What have you been thinking while doing this exercise? What are you thinking right now? How real do thoughts seem?

      "Hallo Ana!

      

      I just found your place and it looks great. I was supposed to stay in Vienna with my friend Clarissa (she's Austrian, I'm French). But unfortunately, she lost a member of her family so we had to change our plans. So this is really last minute, we're just looking for a calm and peaceful place in Graz and your apartment looks to be our best bet.

      

      I'm sorry my German is so poor, ich habe alles vergessen. However, I have read the whole description, and it fits us perfectly. I'm looking forward to our stay in your apartment.

      

      Bis bald! 

      Adrien"

**** I do not know if this is relevant, but I moved to 42 bis avenue de Saxe, Paris in 2010. I didn't specify because that was over 5 years ago. Is it relevant? Before that, I lived at 4 allée Floréal 92190 Meudon. You can see that on my G-325A, for my last address outside the US of more than a year.
**** On my G-325A, for my last address outside the US for more than a year, Avenue is missing the "v".
**** I signed the G-325A nevertheless.

***** Our zip code is 11205, not 11204 for B . 2. and C. 2.

*** Hi Roee! My work visa recently expired and I'm waiting for the new one to kick in. In the meantime, I found myself with a lot of time and not a lot of income. I am coming no matter what to summer escape (last year memorable), but since I have the time I would love to contribute more than before. Since I have all this free time I was wondering if there was any opportunity to participate in the build. I could come as early during the week as needed, and stay as long as well, since I have no responsibility currently. Let me know :)

*** Questions for @GayleOshrin #2016-03-17-Thursday
**** For item #2, the banking statement, what is the recommended period, one month? One year? Just one,
**** For item #3, my wife has not filed for 2013 and 2014 yet. She plans on doing it soon but it could take a while. Can she provide the W2 as an alternative or an estimate? She has been paid under the table. She can have employment letters from other things she has done, but didn't get payment
**** For item #4, she is self-employed, so she cannot get an employment letter (I will give you more details over the phone)
**** Is there an item #8?
**** For the proof of relationship, when are we supposed to provide them? Is it to be included in the packet to be sent, or at the interview? I also have more details to give you.
**** Don't I have to go to the doctor myself?
**** For the pictures, should I deliver them to your office?
*** Questions for @DanaDiRaimondo
**** Background, J1 ends March 31st, got married,
**** Is there any way around the 90 days wait?

*** Consultation on #2016-03-24-Thursday with @DanaDiRaimondo @MeganJones @ElizabethAlves
**** #J1 visa allows for temporary intent, green card path is
**** 30/60 days is mandatory USCIS policy
**** but they understand that plans change, but they don't buy it
**** if it's outside of the 30 days, yellow area, immigration service doesn't do a de facto presumption, need to make the case, bone fide change of heart
**** outside of 60 days, green area, guidance is dark, benefit of the doubt, presume that they have a change of circumstances
**** Application should be withheld outside of the 60 days. It would be in my favor
**** Need to stop considering the green card conversation for now
**** Alternatives
***** #H1B pursued by @BISAM
****** not effective until October, 40% chance
****** positive, most likely succ
****** essful, it allows for dual intent
****** if we find out the H1B wasn't successful, change of circumstances
****** another #J1 is a possiblity, in the meantime
******* no transition to a traineeship
******* no extension
******* possible second internship in the US, but I graduated over a year ago (#2015-03-06)
***** remain here, in the US
****** after the grace period, no legal implication for @ElizabethAlves
****** D/S on the I-94 (duration of stay)
***** most conservative is, and what the government is saying to do
****** depart the US at the end of the #J1
****** #H1B, return in October, pursue the green card
****** if no #H1B, no other means of getting me back here
****** then other #J1, but hard, and if denied by someone, then filing a green card for me while I'm outside the US, takes 9 months to get me back in the US
**** I didn't file the forms for the temporary card. #EAD @GayleOshrin didn't send them to me.
**** Affidavit of support, also not sent to her, @GayleOshrin again
**** Agreement with @BISAM, do it after the beginning of grace period. What about payment tied to my signing? As long as it's
**** other visa types, but not fruitful
***** #O1 but not applicable since I'm a junior, it's for the top of the line
***** #E2, not possible because equity investor, is from Luxembourg and owns 70%
**** period of time, mid-august if I pursue a #GreenCard, or October if #H1B
**** good thing that the H1B application has LCA, 7 business days
**** recommendation for the H1B
***** filing the #H1B request for not change of status, but cancel of request, visa approval
***** filing with premium processing services, 15 calendar days, but last year it was 30 days after #2016-04-01-Friday
**** she needs to think if she can take the case if we give her the #H1B, if not, she could eyeball it, if she takes it
**** Questions
***** If #H1B, can I visit while waiting for it?
***** #DV-2017, any impact? No impact.
**** travelling resets the clock 30/60

**** @DanaDiRaimondo
***** DONE What if I stay in the US, after my grace period, but yet, do not do file for a green card, what does that mean for me?
***** DONE I understand that I need to re-enter the country. Overstaying after my grace period, can it endanger my H1B application/entry? Or when I present myself at the border.
****** A: D/S potentially better position, unlawful presence, 180 days --> 3 years, 1 years --> 10 years, but that's only if I have a fixed date, which I don't have
****** Formal finding, there is no clock ticking
****** Waiting for the #H1B, two weeks of overstaying
****** No triggers, shouldn't prevent me from getting an H1B
****** They could raise questions
****** Visa waiver program is in question, I am not inadmissible but the visa waiver program is a gift, it's a question of the ESTA
****** that is, if I need to renew my ESTA
***** DONE Is there anything in my case that would make me not accepted for the #H1B? What's the probability in the end?
***** DONE If I work abroad, can I visit the United States, specifically end of August
***** DONE Question about conservative way: if #H1B is accepted, that's May 15, you're saying leaving at the conclusion of the #J1, which is April 30
***** DONE I cannot work, but can I go to school? Work for a charity?
**** Notes from the follow-up call #2016-03-30-Wednesday
***** If I decide to leave within the grace period, we hear on #2016-05-16-Monday that I am not selected, I have no basis to re-enter the US long term. I can come visit. I do have a US citizen spouse, I would have to satisfy the CBP, to prove I do not have immigration intent. I would have to file for a green card, up to a year. I can come as a visitor, but a higher burden of scrutiny.
***** Approval of #H1B, not a concern
***** Removal proceeding, I have a basis to stop removal proceeding, it is a silver proceeding,

***** DONE @MeganJones /Clémence are saying that there is a year wait before a contract can be done #20151020
***** Talk with @MeganJones #2015-10-20
***** The external counsel is @GaleOshrin
***** Possible visas:
****** H-1B: @GaleOshrin is confident that it could work out. What if it fails? Application in April, come back in October, stay in London
****** EB-2: on the table, I would have to say that I agree to stay at least two years with @BISAM, and preferably with support, this is a green card
****** O-1: #STLI
****** DONE E-2: not possible because of the fact that BI-SAM Technologies is owned by the Swiss subsidiary
***** Talk with @MeganJones #2015-10-30
***** E2 not possible
***** They like me better than @YohanDuflos (@RichardIrons said he has a twinkle in his eyes, he wants to be here - he is on board)
***** @Katrina, who works at FACC (probably @KatrinaPerito - see https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/faccnyc+katrina/15095836f632553e), is on @MeganJones's swim team, they have a call on #2015-11-03 about my situation
***** @ChristopheVolard is not on board yet, as he doesn't want to jeopardize BI-SAM's ability to do VIE programs in the US. An agreement from the FACC would make him happy.
***** If the H1B doesn't work out, the EB-2 is still on the table. BI-SAM will choose the one that gives me the greater chances of succeeding.
***** Applied to the diversity lottery on #2015-04-02 20173P482FUGEZX9
***** Talk with @DanieleCecchini on #2015-11-11: says that I have to stay one year outside of the country. Says he would like me to come back after 6 months, but cannot do it. They are pushing forward a start date of #2017-04-01
***** #nextstep @DanieleCecchini is going to talk to @MeganJones and I should too. What visa are they thinking about? Maybe EB2 (green card)
***** Talked with @MeganJones #2015-11-12
****** @PhilippeVolard wants to keep being able to do VIE. Thus, he wants not to have issues with FACC. It's the only reason I would have to stay a year outside of NY.
****** Being a year abroad would mean I can do a L1 visa, which we would then convert into a green card.
****** She is still working on it. Everyone thinks six months is better than year.
****** Possibility of living somewhere else. Maybe Malaysia. Somewhere where BISAM doesn't have an office yet.
***** Talked with @DanieleCecchini on #2015-11-17
***** Talked with @MeganJones on #2015-11-18
****** apply for #H1B in April, get it, if there is a way to come back before that, then use it
****** if not, or a year goes by, apply for #L1 with expedited process - this visa should give me more flexibility #TBC)
****** there is still a possibility that the VIE program would be cancelled, for instance 1. people realize they can't use VIE (neither support, nor PS can use it), or 2. another type of contract becomes apparent, let's say internships, or we can use another private entity, CIEE? In that case I could come back as early as #October2017
***** #L1 vs #H1B
****** #L1 spouse can seek employment, no certification required, blanket petition, and can apply to #EB-1(C) which is the fast track to get a #GreenCard #TBC
****** #H1B extension possible, not only for multinationals
***** Questions
****** with an #H1B acquired in #October2016, can I still come on vacation in the US, while I'm waiting for the year to be over?
****** Which #L1 would I get? #L1A (7 years) or #L1B (5 years) --> it looks like I'd be #L1B for specialized knowledge transfer. Apparently we can do a blanket process, which expedites the transfer.
****** Can you get the fast

******* The 20 rules of formatting knowledge
              "https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules"

******** Do not learn if you do not understand
******** Learn before you memorize - build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!
******** Build upon the basics - never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in
******** Stick to the minimum information principle - if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)
******** Cloze deletion is easy and effective - completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulatiung knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners
******** Use imagery - a picture is worth a thousand words
******** Use mnemonic techniques - read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures
******** Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion - obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more
******** Avoid sets - larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!
******** Avoid enumerations - enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion
******** Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
******** Optimize wording - like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims
******** Refer to other memories - building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps
******** Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
******** Rely on emotional states - emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering
******** Context cues simplify wording - providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference
******** Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle - some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!
******** Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance
******** Provide date stamping - time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time
******** Prioritize - effective learning is all about prioritizing. In incremental reading you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete. See also: Incremental reading, Devouring knowledge, Flow of knowledge, Using tasklists

          "Bonjour Laura,

          

          Je reside aux Etats-Unis mais j'utilise encore mon compte LCL, et ma carte visa premier. Cette dernière arrive a expiration en Fevrier 2017. Dans la passé, vos collegues m'ont envoyé des cartes par la poste ici a New York, mais les delais ont été très long, jusqu'à 45 jours pendant lesquels je me suis retrouvé sans moyen de paiement.

          

          Je serais en France à Noel (en région parisienne). Serait-il plus simple pour moi d'obtenir une nouvelle carte en Décembre, qui serait livré à mon domicile français ? Merci de me dire si cela est possible et quelle serait la marche à suivre.

          

          Bien cordialement,

          Adrien Lacquemant

            Each of my users have a custom string and I need to email it to them (it's a ticketing app).

            I have 200 users and I want to email them by waves of 50. Am I safe to email through Bubble? Or do I need to go through a plugin like Sendgrid or Mailchimp?

            

            What has your mileage been? Do emails from Bubble sometimes get flagged as spam? Is there a limit per day of how many emails the Bubble team lets us send?

            

            Thanks in advance!"

***** Courtney sent me
          "For Your Information. 

          

          *Employer's* - please disseminate to all your employees immediately.

          Our Legal advise is that  NO ONE should travel - anywhere - neither international nor domestic.  The current administration is issuing Executive Order’s on immigration without advance notice and with immediate effect thereby trapping and likely to trap thousands of travelers and/or rending families apart.

          

          While the legal system tries to sort this out - you/your families may already be negatively impacted and trying to undo the harm is going to be a much longer and difficult battle than trying to avoid becoming the story.

          THIS APPLIES TO EVERYONE not just those from the 7 list of countries banned for “now.

          

          *EVERYONE*

          CBP is asking to review social media - scrub your phones, empty caches, delete posts from ALL social media - fb, snapchat, instagrams, twitter etc. Any and every account. Disable fingerprint unlock of your phones while traveling.  If asked your opinion about Trump or love of country  - be creative in your positive responses.

          

          *U.S. Citizens*

          Only US Citizen’s have the legal right to DENY access to social media to anyone absent a warrant or Court Order.  If US citizen and a non-white - if they ask to take your passport - ask to see a Judge - your citizenship cannot be revoked absent a judicial determination.  If they take your passport - ask for receipt of same and grounds for such “confiscation”. Be polite but firm.

          US citizens holding  Dual citizenship - read below. You are vulnerable - not protected.

          

          *GC Holders*

          Do NOT sign I-407 - no matter what the pressure. I-407 means you are voluntarily renouncing your Green Card and thereby likely will be denied entry.  A GC thus renounced CANNOT be re-instated. You will have to go through the whole long process that was undertaken earlier to get GC back and by then who knows what policies come into play - whether they will indeed approve issuance of such GC’s in the future. 

          

          You may be asked to prove “ties” to the US - to prove you did not abandon residence in U.S. This means work, family, property, etc.  

          

          Ask to speak to a lawyer - firmly and politely. If they refuse ask for a NTA (Notice to Appear).  If the CBP Officers continue to detain you - ask for a hearing before an Immigration Judge. If the GC is confiscated, ask to be provided with alternative evidence of their LPR status, such as an I-94 and/or passport stamp that says "Evidence of Temporary Residence.” - You are ENTITLED to this.

          

          Currently CBP’s position is that GC holder is NOT entitled to admission to the US on each entry - it will be a case by case determination.  This is probably going to lead to more restrictive admissions.

          

          *Visa Holders*

          No matter what visa you hold, H, L, J, F , B etc. you are the MOST vulnerable. You should absolutely NOT travel neither domestically nor internationally for the rest of 2017 till the dust settles and we can better determine what policies will continue to be implemented.

          

          Visas are being cancelled on arrival and people are being then being banned for 5 years on grounds that they attempted to enter on cancelled visas. This is happening to people NOT on the list of the 7 countries.

          

          *1.* Just because you have a US citizen child - you will NOT be allowed Entry should CBP decide to Deny entry.  US citizen children were being detained over this weekend.

          *2.* People with GC’s NOT on the list of these 7 countries - have had their GC’s taken away.

          *3.* Privacy rules for EVERYBODY - but US Citizens have been removed - thus you cannot Deny access to your social media accounts. An Officer can pretty much deem ANYTHING as grounds to deny entry. In fact CBP Officials have REFUSED to follow the Court Orders issued this past weekend and deported people without allowing them access to lawyers or Senators/Congressman. That means you will have almost little or no recourse if you are detained/deported on attempted Entry.  If they ban you for 5 years - those bans will be almost impossible to overcome in the near future.

          *4.* CG holders and citizen’s traveling DOMESTICALLY have also been stopped, questioned and detained.  

          

          Thus, our recommendation is to *STOP ALL AIR TRAVEL.* The next 6 months or longer are going to be extremely rocky for everyone who is “brown” irrespective of country of nationality/religion/ethnicity. 

          

          TODAY’S UPDATE FROM DHS:

          In the first 30 days, DHS will perform a global country-by-country review of the information each country provides when their citizens apply for a U.S. visa or immigration benefit. Countries will then have 60 days to comply with any requests from the U.S. government to update or improve the quality of the information they provide." 

          This means there is absolutely no certainty of anyone being allowed back in should they travel. Nor is there any certainty as to what other EO’s may come out - except that they are likely to be RESTRICTIVE.

          

          If you have any upcoming travel plans - CANCEL them.  This is going to get worse - not better in the coming months.

****** Original text
            "Thank you so much for going out of your way and inquiring about internships when you and Adrien spoke! I do apologize about he whole delay of sending you this email, things were a mess with college applications and FAFSA but things have died down. I originally started working with SalesForce in late June when the company I currently worked for. In the begging the the month we started exploring our CRM options and eventually decided on SalesForce and Pardot. As the company is still a start up we really had no experience or knowledge of what to do next. A month or so passed and we started to look at implementation partners and after a few unsuccessful ones we found one that we eventually finished the project with. After every step the devs took i took the same steps in a developers account I registered for. I asked questions and asked tons of questions. After they were done I realized that some of the things they did were messy and unorganized so I simply redid them.I really noticed how powerful salesforce was and its true colors after this experience and want to continue working more and more with it.

            

            I would like to broaden my knowledge of SalesForce and be able to do more with it"

****** EAD card arrived #20161031 at @DanaDiRaimondo's office
****** About taxes under VIE
            "Jade Associates worked with the FACC for several months examining local and federal taxlaws that apply to VIEs. After a great deal of research, we are happy to announce that Jade Associates is advising that J-1 VIE Interns and Trainees paid by Business France do not need to file a tax return. According to the U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens (page 16) under the section "Student and exchange visitors", gross income pay received by a foreign employer is exempt from U.S. taxes. 

            

            Although filing a tax return is not required, the U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens (page 6) clearly states that individuals who do not have to file a tax return must still submit Form 8843 to the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Austin, TX 73301-0215, by TaxDay. This form is used to prove that the presence of the taxpayer in the USA is exempt from the substantial presence test or confirming their non-resident status for tax purposes."

          alias mirror='wget -e robots=off -m -r -np'

          Using this alias is simple: just type 'mirror' and then the URL you want to download. For example:

          mirror http://www.mmnt.net/

          would spider and download the entire Mamont FTP database. This is not recommended."

***** Styluses story typed for Maximilian
****** French guy ordered Note 5, didn't styluses. Asks for them. We ship him Note 4 styluses (Arthur). Then he asks again, Arthur says no. Asks again. Arthur says, make a new order. He says no, then is basically coerced into doing it. Buys 7 more phones. Arthur doesn't ship for days. Every hour I ask him to do it, he ignores my messages. Finally he ships the 7 phones, and each time I've asked him, i told him about the styluses. Guess what? There's no styluses in the box. I know that because I must have asked 20 times after the box shipped. Now they're just gonna get rid of the client.

****** —HOMER
****** Back in 1974, National Lampoon published a parody comic-book version of Plato’s Republic. Socrates stands around talking philosophy with a few friends. Each time he makes a point, another guy concedes, “Yes, Socrates, very well put.” In the next frame you see an explosive “POW!!!” and the opponent goes flying through the air. Socrates wins by a knockout. The Lampoon’s Republic has some historical validity; ancient Greeks, like argumentative nerds throughout the ages, loved to imagine themselves as fighters. But even they knew the real-life difference between fighting and arguing. We should, too. We need to distinguish rhetorical argument from the blame-shifting, he-said-she-said squabbling that defines conflict today. In a fight, each disputant tries to win. In an argument, they try to win over an audience—which can comprise the onlookers, television viewers, an electorate, or each other.
****** Meanings
****** “Debate” and “battle” share the same Latin root. Typical of those pugnacious Romans.
****** This chapter will help you distinguish between an argument and a fight, and to choose what you want to get out of an argument. The distinction can determine the survival of a marriage, as the celebrated research psychologist John Gottman proved in the 1980s and 1990s. Working out of his “love lab” at the University of Washington, he and his assistants videotaped hundreds of married couples over a period of nine years, poring over every tape and entering every perceived emotion and logical point into a database. They watched hours and days and months of arguments, of couples glaring at each other and revealing embarrassing things in front of the camera. It was like a bad reality show.

***** Look: Become aware of what you see: notice the richly varied and vivid impressions—shapes, colors, movement, dimensionality, the entire visible world.
***** Listen: Become aware of what you hear: register the various sounds taken in by your ears—a diverse range of intensities, pitches, and tonal qualities, perhaps including the commonplace miracle of speech or the wonder of music.
***** Feel: Become aware of what you touch: texture (smooth, rough, dry, sticky, or wet), weight (heavy, light, solid, or empty), temperature, and the rest. Also note how your body feels right now and compare that to the many other ways it feels at other times, tired or energetic, stiff or limber, painful or pleasant, and so on.
***** Taste: Become aware of what it is like to taste: taste a number of different foods and substances, or remember and vividly imagine their tastes.
***** Smell: Become aware of what you smell: the odor of warm bodies, earth, incense, smoke, perfume, coffee, onions, alcohol, and the sea. Remember and imagine as many of them as you can.
***** Breathing: Attend to your breathing. A moment ago you probably were not consciously aware of your breathing even though you have inhaled and exhaled fifty times while doing this exercise. Hold your breath for a few seconds. Let it out. Now take a deep breath. Notice that being conscious of your breathing allows you to alter it deliberately.
***** Emotions: Become aware of your feelings. Remember the difference between anger and joy, serenity and excitement, and as many other emotions as you care to feel. How real do emotions feel?
***** Thoughts: Become aware of your thoughts. What have you been thinking while doing this exercise? What are you thinking right now? How real do thoughts seem?

****** learning to code
            "I started to learn many languages for my own use, but never reached any lasting proficiency. From Basic in 1999 with the documentation. Then HTML4 to make the layout of my blog around 2003. Then I learned PHP at a basic level. Then FoxPro and Mathlab, as part of my Finance degree, at University. Then while working in banking I used VBA extensively since most of my time was spent in Excel spreadsheets. While interning at a Hedge Fund in New York, I got interested in algo-trading and learned Python on Codecademy, in order to use it on Quantopian.

            Finally I tried to pick up in Swift in 2014, but never went further than an unpublished custom keyboard for iPhone.

            This past month, I have been attending the Bootcamp Prep here at Full Stack Academy and learning JavaScript and I have been making good progress."

****** plans after fullstack
            "After Fullstack, I would like to be primarily employed as a developer, but I already have countless projects that I would like to tackle and have not been able to for lack of knowledge and experience.

            It's a mix of open source projects that I would love to contribute to, my own projects for my own usage, and ideas with friends. I feel like Fullstack will take me there."

****** fs good fit for me
            "I have tried several time to learn how to code, but never reached a sustainable level. I have done tutorials, Codecademy, video courses on Udemy, cloned github repositories to understand some programs. While I was never lost, I have always felt that I never really knew where I was going and was lacking direction. It is okay to make a quick program to a simple action, or fix an issue in existing code, it has never been enough for me to complete the projects I really wanted to do. And even less so, enough to be hired as a developer.

            

            I would like to change that.

            

            From all the information I have been gathering, the feedback I am getting (I met Anton Cataldi randomly in subway in Astoria, thanks to his Fullstack backpack!), I believe Fullstack is the right fit for me. For instance, I am having a great time following the classes led by Corey Greenwald and Sean Bert and take it as indication of the teaching style and quality of the full length programs. Having already spent almost 4 weeks at Fullstack, I would like to continue the adventure. I am also the mayor of Fullstack on Foursquare!

            

            The curriculum goes further than other programs, which is one of the main advantages for me. I feel more secure about employment, and the future with a training such as Fullstack's.

            

            Finally, the quality of the Capstone projects at Fullstack has really impressed me. More than any other bootcamp so far. On top of acquiring experience, I also want to collaborate with other people on projects I probably would not do professionally. I have seen several tackle VR, mobile. Those skills "

***** #FullStackAcademy Week 4 Day 2: ES6, Admission and Optimization
****** ES6
******* ECMAScript is the Oxford dictionary of JavaScript
******* ES5 2009, first major release in 10 years
******* ES6 significantly updated the syntax
******* jQuery one centralized JavaScript that would take care of the the difference between browsers
******* ES7
******* In ES6
******** `if(typeof number === 'number' && !isNaN(number))`
******** the second part is a new ES6 function
******** https://repl.it/JEjK
******** let varMessage; // not defined outside of the scope
******** var function declaration, hoisting, they go to the top
******** let, declaration in line
******** const
********* cannot be reassigned
********* also block scoped
********* most memory efficient
********* you can still push, but you can't reassign
******** arrow functions
********* you don't write function anymore
******** ES6 methods
********* str.include(str2)
********* str.repeat(count)
********* str.startsWith(str2)
****** Admission process
******* Assessment strategy
******** 1 math heavy
******** 1 difficult array/object problem
******** 1 recursion problem 20-25 minutes
******* Interview 50 minutes
******** 5 minutes to talk about oneself
******** 3 problems, at 15 minutes each
********* REACTO
********** R read and repeat the problem
********** E example [1,2,3] => 6

********** C code
********** T test
********** O optimize
****** Big O Notation and Optimizing
******* O, is order of magnitude
******* the time it takes to process the program is growing slower than the growth of the n input
******* O(1): constant time, regardless of the size of the array
******* O(N): directly proportionate to N, we account for the worst case scenario
******* look into bigocheatsheet.com
******* O(N^2): like an array that needs to check for duplicates
******* Sorting algorithms

***** Review of Juke part 1 pairing
****** Up until now all my paring experiences have been good to excellent - and I have enjoyed every single one of them. So this pairing experience came as a surprise to me.
****** He started the workshop without me, didn't look for me in the classroom.
****** Didn't want to alternate roles (I was fine with that though)
****** Didn't provide any input, kept on saying "teach me".
****** When we were taking baby steps he would tell me that was too easy (which doesn't make sense given the next point).
****** Every time I tried to make him "work", or figure out the steps, he would say "I don't know how to do this". Even if I was just trying to figure what we were asked in the instructions.
****** Overall very hard to work with.
****** On Friday we paused, on Monday when we met again he had deleted our work (deleted the commit) and redone the same steps (so the code was different). He had even gone further.
****** I don't particularly want to talk about it (even though I am available if you'd like to discuss this). I would rather make sure that I am not paired with him in the remaining workshops, and in the same group in the senior phase.

***** My answers to the fellowship program application
****** What qualities do you have that would make you an excellent Fellow?
****** As a student, how have you gone above and beyond to make the most of the Fullstack/Grace Hopper experience?
******* I have applied the knowledge from the classes and the workshops not only to the mandatory assignments but also for side projects that I ended up using (mainly sockets.io, React which were new to me). I have worked day and night to make this experience fruitful. I feel that receiving the "mad scientist" award for my Stackathon shows how I am trying to think above and beyond.
****** What ideas do you have to improve the Fullstack/Grace Hopper student experience?
******* So far I have enjoyed every part of the experience. I would just have liked on some specific topics that the best practices were more prominent earlier. However, I feel like this is being addressed by Gabriel and Geoff during the second part of the senior phase.

****** Profile
******* Something interesting
******** I started working in the financial markets but slowly drifted away towards more tech-oriented positions. Eventually, I began freelancing as a "problem solver" leveraging code-less solutions like Bubble, Zapier, Google Sheets, etc. Having attended Fullstack Academy I now feel well equipped to solve business problems with modern technologies.
******* Accomplishment
******** As the CTO of Ara Global Group in Brooklyn, I built an Entreprise Resource Planning software from scratch. This tool included purchasing, asset managing, inventory, sales (+ CRM), shipping. Every department of the 50-people company is running on this piece of software.
******* App that I love
******** I am a workflowy.com dedicated fan. The list-based note-taking app is nothing technically impressive, but the delivery is on point. Not providing any API or integrations makes it even more valuable because every note has to be typed, or at least copy/pasted. The user ends up reviewing his or her notes all the more. I use workflowy for anything and everything and have written over 200 pages of notes over the past two years. I liked it so much that I made my own version (jsFlow).
******** I also use Swarm by Foursquare, but that's more my guilty pleasure!
****** Companies
******* Hive
******** I really like the way Hive solves the project management problem. Instead of replacing existing solutions, Hive integrates them -- upgrading the users' workflows. I am a big believer in automation and have spearheaded initiatives in all my previous positions leveraging tools like Zapier, or custom integrations via Google Scripts. It's more opportunities to work instead of taking care of the administrative tasks. I would love the opportunity to work for Hive, removing the burden from the worker.
******* Simple Fractal
******** I love the fact that everyone on the Simple Fractal team is young and seems dedicated to having an impact on people. Simple Fractal is committed to solving problems, which I can relate to and have tried to do in every job that I had. In banking, I would automate reports even though I was supposed to do it manually. In every job afterward, I have managed to use technology to solve problems going beyond my mandate. Making it my mandate at Simple Fractal would be ideal for me.
******* YipitData
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I understand the value of data, and especially its accuracy. When you have an infinite amount of data, an analyst cannot crunch it all. So I definitely understand and can get behind the mission of YipitData.
******* 1010Data
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I understand the value of data, and especially its accuracy. When you have an infinite amount of data, an analyst cannot crunch it all. So I definitely understand and can get behind the mission of 1010Data.
******* Two Sigma
******** As a former hedge fund analyst turned developer, I cherish Two Sigma's scientific approach to investing and use of technology. Especially in software engineering: I understand the value of data, and especially its accuracy. When you have an infinite amount of data, an analyst cannot crunch it all. So I definitely understand and can get behind the mission of the software engineering department of Two Sigma.
******* pymetrics
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I understand the value of data, and above all its accuracy. When looking for a job, valuable insights are often missed by hiring managers making a job search sub-optimal. This is a problem that I would love helping solve.
******* BlackRock
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I am very well aware of BlackRock's success and reputation but as a developer, I am also interested in contributing with the help of technology. I believe with my training and experience in asset management I am uniquely positioned to join the software engineering team at BlackRock.
******* JP Morgan
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I am very well aware of JP Morgan's success and reputation. As a developer, I am also interested in contributing with the help of technology. I believe with my training and experience in asset management I am uniquely positioned to join the software engineering team at JP Morgan.
******* PDT Partners
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I am very well aware of PDT Partners' success and reputation. As a developer, I am also interested in contributing with the help of technology. I believe with my training and experience in asset management I am uniquely positioned to join the software engineering team at PDT Partners.
******* Bluecore
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I understand the value of data, and especially its accuracy. When you have an infinite amount of data, an analyst cannot crunch it all. So I definitely understand and can get behind the mission of Bluecore. Then as a developer, I also understand the benefits of automation and the insights gained through technology, be it machine learning, or more traditional methodologies.
******* Google
******** It's Google's care for its employees and its commitment to developing junior talent even more than how consistently excellent Google's products have been that draws me to apply today. As a user of the tools for individuals (GSuite), but also for businesses such as the Firebase suite, I would love to participate and learn as a junior software engineer.
******* Amazon
******** It's Amazon's care for its employees and its commitment to developing junior talent even more than how consistently excellent Amazon's products have been that draws me to apply today. As a shopper on Amazon's customer-facing operation, but also a user of the AWS Suite (specifically ec2, lambda and S3), I would love to participate and learn as a junior software engineer.
******* Uber
******** It's Uber's care for its employees and its commitment to developing junior talent even more than how consistently excellent Uber's products have been that draws me to apply today.
******* SimonData
******** As a former hedge fund analyst, I understand the value of data, and especially its accuracy. When you have an infinite amount of data, an analyst cannot crunch it all. So I definitely understand and can get behind the mission of SimonData.

***** Capstone presentation
****** Original Thursday text
******* Google Firebase presented several challenges because the products we used are currently in beta, therefore do not provide all the features developers use on a daily basis. However, Firebase became a clear choice for our application because it allows us to have the same performance for two users, or one hundred, or ten thousand hypothetical users while keeping the costs down. Besides our lightweight frontend most of our processes are not time sensitive, run only at certain time and perform a single task such as generating summaries, or synthesizing audio with IBM Watson for the podcast. It made sense to move away all of this processing away from our main server.
****** Outline
******* Firebase and issues
******** Google Firebase presented several challenges
******** Some of the products we used are still in beta and were missing features.
********* For instance, Cloud functions are running Node 6 and thus leave out ES7
********* or, in Firestore that was released two months ago, it's impossible to list collections within a document
******* But the advantages outweigh the drawbacks
******** Most of our processes run once a day, and are very ressource intensive
******** We generate summaries for thousand of articles, and synthesized the audio for all of them
******** Having an unlimited amount of cloud functions running in parallel
******** as opposed to a single expensive processing server
******** allows us to have the same performance for one, 2 hundred or hypothetically ten thousand subscribers
******** while keeping the cost down
****** DONE bullets
******* Within Firebase Google, Firestore and Cloud functions are still in beta
***** Talked to Seth about workflowy
***** Clone arrays and objects in javascript ES6
****** `const obj = { ...oldObj }`
****** `const arr = [ ...oldArr ]`

We’re becoming less citizens and more subjects.

***** Wrote a message to Reuben with the help of Alex
****** My rate is variable as I get more experience. And as I get more experience, it cannot be expected to stay the same. So I cannot commit to any period of time. That is the nature of contract work. We agreed on a rate 6 months ago given my skillset at the time, but this skillset has evolved and so has the value of my time.
****** To be honest, I think 30 was a great deal and I think 40 is still a great one. I don't expect that rate to change significantly until my situation changes.
****** While I am happy to work on these projects and see them to completion, I want to make sure everyone involved is being treated fairly.
***** Answer
****** Right now we can do $40 for at least the next 4 months.
****** Reuben, you know I enjoy working on these projects and with you. This isn't personal. I think $40 is a fair deal and I cannot make a commitment for longer than 4 months.

***** Message from @ErenErdogan to the fullstack alumni interview channel
****** Hello 1710,
****** First off congrats on finishing Fullstack! It’s a great accomplishment and something you should be really proud of!
****** I’m Eren and I graduated from FS in 1709. Since you are all starting the job search I figured I’d share some resources that I’ve found helpful for me. I am by no means an expert but I have spent way too much money on coding interview resources and tried out a lot of different courses and resources so I figured I’d share my take.
****** Here are some courses/resources I’d really recommend:
****** AlgoExpert
****** https://www.algoexpert.io/product
****** I’m sure you’ve heard of this from your time at Fullstack but it really is awesome. The video explanations are really helpful in understanding the problem and solution. I’d recommend to do them in order of difficulty and to watch the full videos even if you were able to solve it, there’s usually still something useful that you can takeaway.
****** Coderust 2.0
****** https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656?authorName=Coderust
****** Really great set of questions covering a wide range of topics. Each question comes with a detailed description, solution code, and a step by step visual which is really nice. Questions are organized by topic and not difficulty so some can be pretty trivial and some can be really difficult and complex. It was made by engineering managers from Facebook and Microsoft for what it’s worth.
****** LeetCode
****** https://leetcode.com/
****** The industry standard that Software Engineers use to prepare for top companies coding interviews. If your code can pass the test cases on LeetCode, it’s correct. Pretty much every question you could be asked is on LeetCode. Official solutions in LeetCode are usually not there though and it’s up to you to figure it out from the discussion board where people post their own solutions which can be annoying. Questions on Leetcode are also not organized and it can be difficult to get a sense of which ones to do. The explore section helps alleviate this problem and if you have premium you can see which companies frequently ask what, sort questions by frequency, and can access the company prep guides and locked questions.
****** Pramp
****** https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/
****** An awesome resource to practice and simulate a real interview with strangers as you take turns interviewing each other. Questions on this can vary in difficulty based off what you fill out when signing up. You also get feedback from the person interviewing you so that can be really helpful.
****** HackerRank
****** https://www.hackerrank.com/
****** You are probably familiar with this from the admissions process with Fullstack. It has a good amount of practice for specific Data Structures and Algorithms but not too much for coding interviews, some CTCI stuff. Odds are if you get a coding challenge from a company it will be on HackerRank though so I’d get familiar with it at the very least.
****** Cracking The Coding Interview
****** You know what this is. It’s really useful, would def recommend reading chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10.
****** Here’s some Data Structures and Algorithms specific prep, which is an essential topic to know for coding interviews. I haven’t done these but they look dope:
****** Data Structures in Javascript with Visualizations & Hands-on Exercises
****** https://www.educative.io/collection/10370001/160001?authorName=Educative
****** A Visual Introduction to Algorithms
****** https://www.educative.io/collection/10370001/760001?authorName=Educative
****** Being good at coding interviews is 100% based off how much preparation you put in. If you are interested in any of the big tech companies this is the only way to do well. Take the time to put in the preparation and your future self with thank you for it. It’s a pretty awesome feeling when you get asked a question in a real interview and you know exactly how to solve it because you’re prepared and have done it or something similar before.
****** Good luck to you all! If any of you have any questions feel free to message me!

******* Segah helped us out in the very early days of Earnest. We had several data engineering problems that he helped understand requirements, design a solution and build. He's a great communicator and creative problem solver — very analytical and highly motivated.
******* Segah is one of the brightest professionals I had the pleasure of working with. He can hit the ground running on any terrain. As soon as he started working with me, he presented solutions to problems I just started to wrap my head around. He also is a really nice guy and team player. Any team would be lucky to have him on board.
******* Segah was instrumental in helping us get started with Looker at Strava. It didn't take long for him to dive into our database and immediately translate our schema into a set of dashboards with key metrics for the whole company to keep tabs on. He also played a big role in helping non-technical users grasp the core concepts of analyzing data with Looker. Highly recommended.

****** He has several years of JavaScript programming experience building apps at an electronics wholesales in Brooklyn. He built, by himself, an in-house SaaS to manage stock, processing, sales, and shipping of the goods. He also built an Electron app to automate the diagnostic process which was originally completely manual.
****** Adrien is a gifted engineer whose keen eye for design and architecture makes him an incredible asset to xxx. His curiosity and wealth of experience allow him to recognize and harness promising design patterns even before they are widely adopted.
****** I can confirm that Adrien is a very motivated person, with a lot of bright ideas and a constant striving to self-perfection and I think he would be perfect for our front-end team.

****** Hey {name},
****** My name is Adrien and I'm a Software Engineer in NYC. I was looking at {COMPANY} and came across your profile. I'd love to connect and learn more about your role at {COMPANY}.
***** Application to FanDuel
****** Favorite language
******* I have tried and learned many languages, for different tasks. In chronological order: BASIC, HTML, PHP, VBA, Foxpro, Python, Swift, Ruby and finally JavaScript/TypeScript
******* While they all serve a purpose, JavaScript is the one that is the most omnipotent. For anything you may want to do, there is probably a library or bindings that exist in JavaScript. I once built an application to interact with a machine's COM ports... in JavaScript.
******* JavaScript is my favorite, but I may look into other languages in the near future such as ReasonML for functional programming and Lisp because I am a big fan of emacs.
****** Blog
******* It is not a blog per se, but I am a big fan of Ken Dodd's newsletter. It's broader interesting topics in the JavaScript world, opinion pieces and doesn't read like a news publication or blog. It's available here: https://tinyletter.com/kentcdodds
****** Proudest
******* I am the proudest of an Electron application that can scan iOS devices and extract information such as model, capacity, color. origin, etc. The application is used in warehouses in Florida to process their incoming stock of new and used iPhones and iPad. The application has been used more than 100,000 times and saved up a lot on processing that was originally done manually.

            "Hi Nick!

            

            I'd like to apply to the front end engineer position at Radar. 

            

            I am currently a Teaching Fellow at Fullstack Academy, a coding bootcamp, and I have two years of JavaScript programming experience building apps working as a contractor, including a B2B Electron app in collaboration with my former employer and several other React/Redux projects.

            

            I believe that location awareness/intelligence has enormous growth potential and would love to join a company in the field, especially in such an early stage like at Radar. Last month I made my own iOS application that used geofences to notify you when you reach your transit stop.

            

            Would love to chat, let me know, thanks!

            Adrien"

          "INTERVIEW PROBLEM - (Challenging) - COIN CHANGE 

          Problem Statement 

          Given a set of coins with various arbitrary denominations, and a total amount of money (cents), find the minimum number of coins whose denominations would sum to that total.

          

          Simple Example: coin_change([25,10,5,1],32) => 4  (Greedy approach works here)

          Counter Example: coin_change ([4,3,1],6) => 2  (Greedy approach does NOT work here, would return 3 (4+1+1). Need to explore all cases and realize 3+3 is more optimal

          

          3 Solution Levels:

          Non-recursive, greedy algorithm solution

          Recursive Solution: 

          Basic Dynamic Programming (Memoization) solution

          Coin Change Interviewer Prompts 

          

          If you're running the interviewer through this question, they're likely going to be a more advanced candidate who's done quite well on the previous problems. Still, it may be helpful to remind them that this problem uses recursion, and thus steer them towards thinking about both the base and recursive cases. 

          

          Start with standard example of US Coin Currency. Most candidates will then try the greedy approach. This is still a non-trivial approach for a non-experienced programmer to solve, so let them code it out. They should be able to solve without too much help.

          Once they've solved with a greedy approach, show them the greedy algorithm counterexample ([4,3,1],6). Ask them what their approach will return. They'll realize it's wrong. Then you work together to solve with the recursive solution. 

          Tell them it requires recursive, encourage to start with defining the base case (where the remaining amount is equal to a coin's denomination that you have.) Base case scenario returns 1 coin.

          After that ask: How can we make a recursive call that brings us towards the base case? See video walkthrough above.

          

          Coin change notes--if you want to optimize the problem, you can use memoization--storing some of the pre-found values in a data store in the function; i.e. a global variable 

          

          Below is a great resource (not written in JavaScript, unfortunately) which discusses a few of the more interesting bits of the Coin Change problem. If you end up diving deeply into this problem, feel free to send along this reading to the interviewees--the more teachable moments you shove into an interview, the more they'll be impressed by Fullstack. Remember, your job is to make interviewees understand how much we care about teaching.

*** What is the criticism of TED talks
      "The world would be quite different if 20 minutes watching Youtube could actually change your life.

      TED talks are like church services for white people who want to feel smart. You sit down, you watch a person give a carefully rehersed speech designed to make you feel like you’re learning something, you walk away feeling smart and superior, and an hour later you forget about it.

****** Thank you, [~nayouta], for your answer.
****** However, I believed that in the previous algorithm this did not apply because it was by instrument type. So we would not have a different offset for each instrument version, but instead several instruments would generate one offset based on the instrument type and currency.
****** In 3.10.0 as in 3.8.0 OFI is not assigning/loading offsets themselves. They are being generated by B-One, and in the new algorithm, they are generated for each instrument (becau.

****** #LMI call

******* Reach out to R&D for #27436
****** @BorisThiam and @DanieleCecchini had another call with #LMI to discuss the usage of the support website, the email that summarize it is named: "BI-SAM Customer Support call"
            "Hello Larry,

            

             

            

            Thank you for joining the call today, I am pleased we had this opportunity to discuss your concerns regarding Customer Support.

            

            

            We worked through a number of issues, which have been encountered when creating tickets:

            

            1)      Responding to tickets via email seem to be producing duplicate tickets

            

            2)      Attachments sent through by email aren’t visible in the ticket

            

            3)      Screenshots added to the body of emails weren’t visible

            

             

            

            We didn’t manage to reproduce these issues on the call, however, in an attempt to avoid these issues in the future, it was recommended that any new email was sent only to the Customer Support email (customersupport@bi-sam.com) and have no other emails in copy.  If additional contacts are to be included, Customer Support can add these contacts.  Please let me know if these issues occur again and I will investigate further to try and identify the underlying issue.

            

             

            

            The other concern raised was regarding Customer Support’s knowledge of Liberty Mutual’s configuration of B-One.  While a handover was done between the Professional Services team and Customer Support not all aspects of the set up are covered during these calls.  Certain functions, such as workflows, where the customer is able to create and configure the system, are not generally reviewed.  However, in the instance mentioned, where workflows were created to manage an identified bug within B-One, Customer Support should have noted this scenario and I will review this with Sally and the team to ensure we are aware of any nuances in the system.

            

             

            

            Finally, we mentioned the ability to access your environment to perform some preliminary troubleshooting rather than asking you questions regarding your environment.  This isn’t done as standard practice to ensure privacy of data, however, as discussed, if you would like to us to directly access either your UAT or production environments to work through issues, please confirm that you are willing to allow us access.

            

             

            

            If you have any other concerns or need to escalate a ticket please contact me directly.

            

             

            

            Kind regards,

            

            Dan"

**** Write up
***** Introduction
****** A virtual DOM tree is a Javascript data structure that describes a DOM tree. It consists of nested virtual DOM nodes, also known as vnodes. The first time a virtual tree is rendered it sets a blueprint to create a DOM tree that will match its structure.
****** Why is this useful? Let's say we change something in our virtual DOM, we get a new Virtual Tree. Then we can compare the old tree to the new tree, single out the differences and apply to them to the actual DOM.
***** Example DOM
****** <div class="container">
******* <h1>Hello world</h1>
******* <p>Some text</p>
****** </div>
***** What would that tree look like, as an object?
****** {type: div, props: {'class': 'container'}, children: [
******* {type: h1, children: ['Hello world']}
******* {type: p, children: ['Some text']}
******* ]}
***** see https://medium.com/p/f7e2503a55fd

***** Part 1
****** if you add dev, you won't package the dependency to your production environment
****** for the `db.define`, the email, we can add: `unique: true`
****** on the #Sequelize objects, no need to use dataValues, you can just call `object.title` directly
****** in #Sequelize you always add a catch to always catch them
****** at the end of the Express routing we need to add `app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {});` to catch all the potential errors
****** `.replace(/s+/g, '_')`  to remove all the whitespace
****** `findAll` returns an array, `findOne` one result
****** `hooks`, and `getterMethods` are just diametrically opposed
***** Part 2
****** `Page.belongsTo` tries to create a new table
****** `.spread` for promises, spread the values returned
            "`ExamplePromise

              .spread(function (user, wasCreatedBool) {

                // etc.

            }

            `"

****** `Sequelize.ARRAY` is for Postgres only
****** the model can deal with the tags, with the `set: function (str) {}`
****** and within that set we need to use `this.setDataValue('tags', arrayOfTags);`
****** you can use `$overlap` to see if tags have overlap, see solution

***** App overview
****** Intro
******* Hi everybody... Let's discuss something we all spend too much time on in the morning. Something important, and I'm not talking about coffee. I'm talking about everything else: all the content you need to get your day started. As it currently stands, we spend far too much time bouncing between apps in the morning to catch up on current events.  What an inefficient use of our time. And time is fleeting, so let's not waste any of it. That's where we come in.  With summaries you get all of the content you want in a concise manner. So what is summaries.io? What a great question, and to help answer that let me introduce my good friend Allison.
***** Leah, How we built it
****** Script:
******* Thanks, Mo. Summaries.io is a web application where you can pick and choose your favorite news providers and we deliver to you a daily summarization of your selected content. After logging in with Google, you will arrive at a dashboard where you can configure news subscriptions. We have a wide selection of news sources to choose from, and we have built a power search for your convenience. Once you go back to the home page, our cloud functions automatically run every morning, so the next day you can see a beautiful, sleek preview of your daily summaries.
******* But we are so much more than a regular news aggregator - we deliver our content in the most dynamic formats. We are available in a web app, mobile app, we send to you a daily briefing email,   and we have an autogenerated podcast powered by IBM Watson. So how did we manage to cater to so many services and platforms? Here's my teammate Eren to take you through the technologies.
***** Eren
****** DONE PWA
****** DONE Emails
****** Script:
******* Sure, thanks Allison. First and foremost, summaries.io is a progressive web app built with React and Firebase. As a progressive web app, it allows users to save summaries.io to their home screen and use it just like a native mobile app. Users who saved summaries.io to their device can open it from the homepage of their mobile device and use it on the go, even offline. We used the latest software development technologies and scored a 91 for a Progressive Web App, 100 for Best Practices, and a 81 for accessibility by Google Lighthouse. We also deliver our summaries as an email every morning through Firebase Cloud functions so our users can start their day with their favorite content. We built summaries.io so our user can user it how ever they want, where ever they want. To talk more about Firebase and the other technologies we used here’s Adrien
***** Adrien
****** Thanks, Eren. Let me a quick tour of what goes on under the hood, our app is powered by Firestore and Cloud Functions. Every morning, cloud functions are triggered to fetch current articles from the News API. Then, we run these articles through a summarization API which parses the content and returns a summary. Once we store everything in Firestore, another cloud function creates a digest for each user. The last function uses IBM Watson to generate audio files for the podcast, and finally sends out emails to our users through nodemailer.
****** Although using Firestore and Cloud function was challenging due to the fact that it's currently in beta, it helped us learn about backward compatibility. More importantly, using those services was a huge win for scalability. Most of our processes run once a day, and are very resource intensive. We can have an unlimited amount of cloud functions running in parallel, instead of a single expensive processing server. We can achieve the same performance for one, 2 hundred or hypothetically ten thousand users. You are welcome to check out our site at summaries.io and look out for an email from us tomorrow morning! Now, I would like to introduce the fifth member of the team, Watson.
****** ------
****** But the advantages outweigh the drawbacks
******* Most of our processes run once a day, and are very ressource intensive
******* We generate summaries for thousand of articles, and synthesize the audio for all of them
******* Having an unlimited amount of cloud functions running in parallel
******* as opposed to a single expensive processing server
******* allows us to have the same performance for one, 2 hundred or hypothetically ten thousand subscribers
******* while keeping the cost down

**** Two Number Sum
***** Question
****** Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in sorted order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. Assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.
****** Sample input: [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6], 10
***** Hint 1
****** Try using two for loops to sum all possible pairs of numbers in the input array. What are the time and space implications of this approach?
***** Hint 2
****** Realize that for every number X in the input array, you are essentially trying to find a corresponding number Y such that X + Y = targetSum. With two variables in this equation known to you, it shouldn't be hard to solve for Y.
***** Hint 3
****** Try storing every number in a hash table, solving the equation mentioned in Hint #2 for every number, and checking if the Y that you find is stored in the hash table. What are the time and space implications of this approach?
***** Time/space complexity
****** O(n) time and space

*** Thoughts
**** We should have a way to separate tracks with music from the one with voice and not treat them the same way. This is a big maybe. Refer to this excerpt below from the Will Dervo Dejavu walkthrough
        "At the front of the pack is “Mirrors” by Justin Timberlake, with over 240k fingerprints, followed by “Blurred Lines” by Robin Thicke with 180k. At the bottom is the acapella “Cups” which is a sparsely instrumented song - just voice and literally a cup. In contract, listen to “Mirrors”. You’ll notice the obvious “wall of noise” instrumentation and arranging the fills out the frequency spectrum from high to low, meaning that the spectrogram is abound with peaks in high and low frequencies alike. "

**** about us
***** take page 4
***** Content
****** Our mission
******* iCycle Green (iCycle) was formed due to a need for responsible recycling of smartphone devices. As smartphones continue to become an important aspect of our lives, old technology becomes obsolete and discarded. This leads to a need to responsibly recycle these devices to ensure that the environment is protected from harsh metals and components.
****** What we do
******* Our recycling program helps organizations and businesses turn their old electronics assets into cash, while saving the environment. Corporations trust iCycle to make sure their data is properly sanitized, and their old smartphones are properly recycled, all while increasing cash flow.
****** Strategic alliances
******* We have partnered with a variety of Global 3000 companies to leverage our efficient reverse logistics supply chain and help manage their end of life devices. We have worked with organizations in various sectors of the global economy such as technology, wholesale distribution, finance, and government. Our expertise and experience has allowed us to learn exactly what it is that our clients need: once your devices (device, sim card, and SD card) are in our hands, you can feel comfortable they will be properly sanitized and recycled.
****** Responsible recycling
******* We have the proper downstream channels and facilities to make sure all batteries, circuit boards, and all other scraps parts are properly recycled and destroyed. We value the landfills as much as we value the devices, as we have a strict zero landfill policy.
**** data security
***** Content
****** Data Security is a growing concern for businesses and organizations. Each year, more than a billion wireless phones are decommissioned worldwide.
****** Organizations have a responsibility to ensure their wireless devices are handled in a way that doesn’t threaten sensitive company or personal information or contaminates the environment. The average smartphone contains 8-10 GB of data, which is comprised of contacts, emails, work documents, passwords, text messages, and media.
****** Surprisingly, only *10%* of these phones are recycled and data wiped, leaving many organizations at risk of data breaches when their equipment is offsite.
****** Ensuring the data is properly removed requires a rigorous process and specially trained technicians.
**** process page
***** Content
****** The majority of organizations retire their mobile devices within 12-24 months. At this stage, eligible devices retain a substantial percentage of their retail value.
****** Contact us by phone or email and let us know what you have. We will offer the industries most competitive buying pricing. Once we have agreed on the details of the deal, we will email you a prepaid shipping label with all information already filled in. >> When orders arrive they are matched to the invoice. All serial numbers/IMEI's are then recorded and stored in our system. Devices are data whipped and sanitized. They are then given to the quality control team to be tested for functionality and reset. We can provide time stamped certificates. The cleared devices are then entered into our inventory system for resale and stored in our federally protected Miami Free Zone compound with bank level security. A final report will be sent to you along with payment.
****** We can customize any of the procedures of our wiping process to our customer’s request.

***** DONE Remarks @ReubenRodriguez #20170220-Monday
****** DONE 1. Can we add the cost price/sale price/ profit per line when we go to a certain invoice within bubble. It gives us the totals which is nice but I would like to see a line by line per unit break down as well. To see and understand why certain units had more profit then others.
****** DONE 2. I sent you the whatsapp about the sale that partially went through
****** DONE 9. Also in sales data can we add in the line by line report of the invoice a turnover time. Meaning it was purchased on Jan 1 sold Feb 15 it would have a turn over time of 45 days. Also add an average turnover of the whole invoice (not a complete idea but something we can discuss)
****** DONE 12. Can we color code the line items according to profit in the invoice dashboard. For example when we look at the report of a invoice with the phones line by line we will have cost sale price and profit per line. We also want the phone line to be highlighted/color coded Green/Red indicating a profit or a loss.
****** DONE 3. We want to use the multiple phone look up to add/edit cost per unit for unlocks. Plus i know you have on your list to make the date by date unlocking inventory.
****** DONE 4. Look up/create purchase order statistics/dashboard meaning that if we make a purchase bubble can give us a per unit breakout and analysis of the purchase ex. 20% A stock 40% B stock (maybe we can do this within the incoming dashboard. Once the order is processed you can click on the green button that says processed and it will give you the break out of the order?
****** DONE 8. Commissions numbers are not accurate in the sales data summary at the top during searches.
****** DONE 11. We want to be able to add notes to the outgoing page per invoice for partial orders or any other shipping note
****** DONE 16. RMA sheet recognizing RMAs from previous orders and marking them as not under warranty.
******* Need clarification

****** 6. I think we should treat repairs like we are thinking about doing unlocks in batches. Repair tech would get a batch of different phones and he needs to hand back that same batch. Problem is that courtney used to hold on to phones he couldn't fix and check back to them. I dont know how we would do that but we need to know which phones were repaired and account for them going to repairs and coming back.

****** 6. In the sales section how do I make the search by invoice function work. I see the space to look for the invoice but when I enter an invoice number nothing happens.
***** Vendor Return dashboard
****** 7. The vendor RMA dashboard is great that it shows how much we are owed, is there a way to add a total at the top, also to have admin only access to mark them as refunded or credited and it reflects the running balance at the top.
***** Add ROI percentage on the sales dashboard per invoice (15.)
***** display vendor invoice on vendor RMA dashboard + link
****** need to add to the detail view too
****** make it a link as well
****** 5. Vendor RMA should have corresponding invoice number or link to the incoming invoice, or some way to know which RMA is attached to which purchase. It would make things more visible to see if an RMA has the correct number of phones on it, which can be verified through the purchase invoice, the inventory trades and then looking at how many phones were returned. For instance I look at the Lotusse order of 43 ipads i see that 33 were placed into the trades of inventory and 9 were returned via the vendor returns dashboard.
***** profit of the incoming stock, on that page
****** 14. Purchase Profit report dashboard. We want to be able to go back a month from a purchase and see a report that shows us by IMEI how much we made. Kind of like the invoice sale dashboard but on purchases. for example we would see on a purhase from IT we have sold 400 out of 500 of the phones we purchased with a $10k profit from the purchase order

            "Hey (Name),

            

            I am reaching out to you on behalf of my company ARA Global Group. We are a distributor of used electronics worldwide. We are looking to purchase your company's used smartphones and tablets. 

            We have heard great things about (Company Name) and want to know how we can get involved with you through a buy it now list or auctions. 

            We just received a new round of financing and are looking to intake more inventory/stock so we are looking for new vendors to work with. We have plenty of references from some of the biggest names in the industry so I think we are definitely capable of establishing a mutually beneficial business relationship. 

            

            Looking forward to hearing back from you.  "
